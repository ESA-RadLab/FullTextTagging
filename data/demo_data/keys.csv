Young Adult","OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an established treatment modality for vestibular schwannomas (VSs). The tumor control and hearing preservation rates suggest that GKRS is a good alternative treatment for small- and medium-size VS. Data are lacking from India regarding GKRS for VSs. Our aim was to find the hearing preservation and tumor control rates and the factors contributing to these.
METHODS: In a retrospective 9-year study period, 87 patients had undergone GKRS for unilateral VS with Gardner-Robertson (GR) class I or II serviceable hearing. All 87 had been evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and audiometry before GKRS and during follow-up to assess for the factors influencing tumor control and hearing preservation.
RESULTS: Of the 87 patients, 77 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years and magnetic resonance imaging and audiometry evaluations available were included in the present study. The median follow-up period was 30 months. The tumor control rate and hearing preservation rate was 96.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Hearing preservation was not affected by the tumor volume. However, age >40 years, pre-GKRS pure tone average <30 decibels, speech discrimination score >85%, pre-GKRS Gardner-Robertson grade I hearing, mean cochlear dose <4 Gy, and pre-GKRS Ohata class of laterality C, D, E were significant on univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis revealed that age >40 years (P = 0.017), pre-GKRS pure tone average <30 decibels (P = 0.002), and Gardner-Robertson class I (P = 0.001) were significant factors. No patient developed cranial nerve dysfunction, hydrocephalus, or malignant degeneration.
CONCLUSION: For most patients with small VSs, GKRS will be an effective alternative treatment to microsurgery with retained serviceable hearing and good tumor control.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med16&AN=30862586

CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months. The 2-year survival rate after CNS relapse was 13%. There was no difference in overall survival among patients with or without CNS disease. Conclusion(s): CNS relapse is a rare occurrence in AML (5%) and is associated with a poor prognosis. A high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutations was observed in these pts. FLT3 mutational status and LDH level may identify patients with AML who may benefit from CNS prophylaxis.","http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/32/15_suppl/7074?sid=4d90f667-d0d6-4431-92cc-490d284b9cf7

In the present study, the number of mast cells and the expression of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) in salivary glands were examined 10 days after a regimen of irradiation. The irradiation was given as a single dose or 5 consecutive days with daily doses of 7 Gy up to a total dose of 35 Gy. In addition, the number of mast cells and the expression of SP were examined 2 and 24 h after a single dose of 7 Gy. Immunohistochemical staining for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and staining with avidin peroxidase and toluidine blue were used to detect mast cells. At examination 2 and 24 h after irradiation treatment, no change in the number of mast cells and the pattern of SP expression was observed. Ten days after irradiation there was a remarkable reduction in the number of mast cells in all the three glands, but there was a marked increase in the number of nerve fibers showing SP-like immunoreactivity in the parenchyme. The results show that early time-dependent alterations in the density of mast cells occur in response to irradiation, and that these changes occur concomitantly with changes in the expression of SP. Since the peripheral nervous system is a main regulator of salivary gland function, it is tempting to speculate that the nervous system interacts with mast cells via SP in modulating irradiation provoked tissue responses in salivary glands.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&AN=9861337

In the present study, the aim was to evaluate whether irradiation can have effects on individual cells that normally synthesize neuropeptides. In addition, since these neuropeptides are potentially mitogenic, we studied tumor cells. Therefore, the estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and its subline, with acquired doxorubicin resistance, MDA-MB-231 Dox were examined before irradiation and 4, 10, and 15 days after irradiation with 4 Gy (195 kV, 2 Gy fractions with 4 hours interval). Potential dose related changes were studied by delivering single doses of 2 or 9 Gy with the same technique. Immunohistochemical and radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods were used for detection of the SP and BN/GRP. Before, and at all time points following irradiation, a subpopulation in both cell lines displayed an intense immunostaining of SP and BN/GRP. A partial reorganization of the immunoreactive material was observed 10 days after irradiation. The RIA-analyses displayed signs of a dose-related increase, and a time-dependent transient and significant increase in the content of both peptides. The pattern of changes differed between the two peptides, and was especially pronounced in the doxorubicin resistant cells with regard to SP. Another neuropeptide, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), was not detected in the cells used. The results suggest that irradiation has effects on a population of cultured neuropeptide-synthesizing cells. The occurrence and the specific changes obtained in the levels of neuropeptides, in response to irradiation, might imply an importance in the growth of breast cancer cells and in explaining repair processes following irradiation.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&AN=9493854

Previously, we demonstrated that irradiation induces an increase in the expression of BN/GRP in the innervation of the salivary glands in rats. We therefore carried out a study using radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis and immunohistochemistry to examine whether saliva contains BN and whether irradiation affects the BN release to saliva in rats. Immunoreactivity for BN was detected not only in the innervation of the parenchyma but also in the duct cells and in the lumina of the ducts, suggesting entrance of BN into saliva. The RIA analysis confirmed that rat saliva contains a BN-like peptide. The observation shows that saliva contains this peptide but that there is no significant increase following the radiation schedule used. Nevertheless, the occurrence of an enhanced expression of BN in different peripheral tissues such as the salivary and laryngeal glands should be taken into consideration when discussing the clinically important problem of reduced food intake and anorexia in cancer patients.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&AN=10665769

Radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods were also used. Immunoreactive granular structures were observed within duct cells of both controls and irradiated animals. In the parenchyma of irradiated animals, very few nerve fibres showing BN-like immunoreactivity were observed. The RIA analysis showed that the content of BN-like material significantly increased in submandibular and parotid glands in response to irradiation. The results suggest that mainly a non-neural form of BN is detected in the salivary glands in the immunohistochemical analysis. Thus, the immunohistochemical observations suggest that BN-like peptides may be present in the duct system, where they may be constituents of the saliva. The observations of an increase in BN content in response to irradiation are of interest as BN has mitogenic effects, may stimulate secretion and contributes to satiety.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&AN=9179870

Patients and Methods All patients (n = 4142) diagnosed with SCLC from 1995 to 2012 were identified from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry in the Eindhoven region. Results The prevalence of comorbidity increased from 55% in 1995 to 1998 to 76% in 2011 to 2012 and multimorbidity (ie, >= 2 concomitant diseases) from 23% to 51%. The prevalence of a comorbidity increased with age. Among the men, hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes, in particular, became more common (increased from 11% to 35%, from 19% to 36%, and from 7% to 18%, respectively). In the women, the rate of pulmonary disease, hypertension, and cardiac disease increased the most (increased from 18% to 30%, from 12% to 28%, and from 11% to 24%, respectively). Multimorbidity was associated with a slightly increased hazard of death, independent of treatment in those with limited-stage SCLC (hazard ratio [HR] for >= 2 comorbidities vs. no comorbidities, 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.4). The prognostic effects of multimorbidity resulted from treatment in those with extensive-stage SCLC (HR for >= 2 comorbidities vs. no comorbidities, final model, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2). The prognostic impact of the specific comorbidities varied, with digestive disease reducing the hazard and cardiac disease increasing the hazard in those with limited-stage SCLC (HR for digestive disease vs. no digestive disease, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.5-0.9], and HR for cardiac vs. no cardiac disease, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3]). Also, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease increased the hazard in those with extensive-stage SCLC (HR 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3] and HR 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6], respectively). Conclusion Comorbidity among patients with SCLC is very common and has been increasing. Multimorbidity was associated with a slightly increased hazard of death in those with limited-stage SCLC, independent of treatment. However, the prognostic effects in those with advanced-stage SCLC resulted from treatment. Digestive disease favorably affected survival and cardiac disease negatively affected the prognosis for those with limited-stage SCLC, and cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases had a negative prognostic effect for those with extensive-stage SCLC. With the burden of comorbidities in patients with SCLC increasing, more attention to individualized treatment approaches is needed. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients treated at the Norwegian Radium Hospital from May 1996 to October 1999 participated in the study. Daily life activities were assessed at start and discontinuation of radiotherapy and 2 and 6 months thereafter using a questionnaire based on a slightly modified Barthel activity of daily living Index. The patients were followed to death. Clinical parameters (histology, extent of disease at diagnosis, time from cancer diagnosis to start of radiotherapy, time from neurological symptoms to start of radiotherapy, age, number of spinal lesions, pre-treatment function) were assessed to try to prognosticate post-treatment function. Result(s): Forty-nine patients were evaluable. Time from debut of neurological deficits to start of radiotherapy was median 4 days (range 1-66). Median target dose was 30 Gy (range 9-40). Overall survival from start of radiotherapy was median 3.5 months (range 0.3-36.0). In general, improvement with regard to mobility, daily life activities and sphincter control was reported after irradiation. Post-treatment the majority of patients reported pain, usually intermittent, although they used analgesics. No clinically relevant pre-treatment parameters that predicted function after radiotherapy were identified. Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy may improve mobility, daily life activity and sphincter control in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression due to hormone resistant prostate cancer. Radiotherapy should therefore be considered in all patients irrespective of the neurological deficits. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

*Temporal Lobe/re [Radiation Effects]","Cognitive decline is a significant but largely unrecognized sequela following irradiation for several head and neck tumors, particularly cancer of the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses. In this article the cellular mechanisms of radiation-induced vascular damage in the temporal lobe and its effects on the medial temporal lobe memory systems are described. Recognition of the mechanisms and site of the injury should permit the use of treatment planning systems, such as 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques, to spare large volumes of the temporal lobe from receiving a high dose. Furthermore, the emerging concepts of vascular irradiation damage as an inflammatory fibroproliferative response to endothelial injury may permit the application of measures directed at inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory genes and thus mitigate the inflammatory response. Moreover, comorbid factors such as hypertension, diabetes, lipidemia, obesity and smoking are known to promote atherogenesis and therefore may exacerbate radiation-induced vascular damage. Control of these factors may also reduce the incidence and severity of this sequela. [References: 61]","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&AN=12234025

Method(s): After institutional review board approval, data on women with NET of the cervix treated at our institution between January 1, 1999 and June 30, 2014 were abstracted for analysis. Demographic, clinical, radiological, pathological, and progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS) data were collected. T-test was used for univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): Of 1469 women with cervical cancer, 21 (1.4%) had NET histology. The median age of those with NET was 47 years and average tumor size was 5.2 cm. Tumors >4 cm and small cell subtypes were seen in 48% and 52%, respectively. Stage IA-IB1was noted in nine (43%), IB2- IVA in sic (29%), and IVB in sic cases. Six patients underwent primary radical hysterectomy with lymph node (LN) dissection (29%) and four (19%) received neoadjuvant treatment with external pelvic radiation (RT) or chemotherapy (CT) (2) followed by hysterectomy. Adjuvant therapy was administered in five cases (24%), with two receiving CT alone and three receiving combined CT and RT (CCR). Three patients received definitive CCR (14%), four definitive RT (19%), and one palliative CT alone. Three never followed-up after diagnosis. CT consisted of etoposide/cisplatin (n=5), etoposide/carboplatin (n=5), and carboplatin/paclitaxel (n=1). Patients who received RT had significantly shorter OS (P=0.02). Median PFS of 26.9 months and median OS of 35.7 months were noted, with seven recurrences in 18 patients available for follow-up (39%). Although patients with stage IA- IB1 disease had improved outcomes compared to stage IB2-IVA and IVB (PFS: 35.7 vs. 8 vs. 7.8 months; OS: 39.8 vs. 13.7 vs. 7.8 months) and lower recurrence rate (RR) (20% vs. 60% vs. 66%), this did not reach statistical significance. Other variables, including tumor size, type of treatment, age, LN status, and tobacco use, were not associated with survival or RR. Conclusion(s): NET of the cervix is a rare malignancy that presents at a relatively young age with bulky tumors and advanced-stage disease. No prognostic factors were identified, although early-stage disease seems to be associated with improved survival. Optimal management is yet to be determined, and multimodality treatment is often advocated.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&AN=71869661
