We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFκB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFκB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFκB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFκB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFκB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFκB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFκB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFκB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs.

The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.</p><p>Ionizing radiation commonly utilized in medicine particularly for X-ray tomography, surgical guidance, and radiotherapy 1 can be as high as 50 Gys 2 . Although radiation in this setting has clear therapeutic and medical value, it is important to consider the unintended consequences of high-dose ionizing radiation. The effects of radiation on cells and DNA damage are well documented 3 and negatively affect multiple organ systems including the heart, lung, and kidneys [4] [5] [6] . Patients receiving focal radiation treatment for abdominal cancers experience a dramatic bone loss resulting in a high proportion of vertebral compression fractures 7 , highlighting severe consequences of focused radiation on peripheral tissues 3 . Ionizing radiation can also damage the extracellular matrix, by cleaving the protein structure and creating crosslinks 8 . Immediately adjacent to the vertebrae, the intervertebral disc (IVD) may also be susceptible to radiation exposure.</p><p>The IVD consists of cells that are metabolically responsive to environmental conditions including injury 9 , senescence 10 , and genotoxic signals that include reactive oxygen species, advanced glycation endproducts, and radiation 11 . Exposure to these toxic and damage factors in turn can trigger toll-like receptors (TLRs) [12] [13] [14] and interleukins-1 receptors (IL1Rs) 10 that activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling and inducing the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines 15 . The prolonged expression of these inflammatory cytokines is tightly linked to IVD injury, degeneration 16, 17 , and low back pain 18, 19 . However, the effects of ionizing radiation on the IVD at the cell and tissue levels remain relatively unknown.</p><p>Since radiation can concurrently affect multiple organs, whose responses may in turn cross-talk with the organ of interest, the ex vivo IVD organ culture approach is particularly elegant for decoupling the tissue-specific vs. the systemic effects of complex stimuli [20] [21] [22] . The use of genetically modified mouse models provides additional mechanistic insights by enabling the real-time reporting of molecular events or the ablation key signaling pathways 9 . Thus, to investigate the effects of X-ray radiation on the IVD, we applied an organ culture of mouse functional spine units (FSUs) 9, 23 . The FSUs are exposed to a single regimen X-ray radiation totaling 20 Gys, which is in the range of clinical use for radiotherapy 2, 7 and cultured for 10 days to observe the downstream effects of radiation.</p><p>Because NFκB integrates signaling from radiationsensitive receptors 24 , we utilized mice with an NFκB-driven bioluminescence reporter (NFκB-eGFPluc) 25 to monitor the IVD-specific temporal response to X-ray irradiation. In order to decouple the radiationmediated inflammatory response from the matrix-level effects, we utilized a mouse with a global deficiency in myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) 26 . MyD88 is an adapter protein that transfers signals from toll-like receptors, advanced glycation end-products receptors, and interleukin receptors to initiate NFκB signaling, and it has crucial roles in inflammatory and senescence-related degeneration of the intervertebral disc 27, 28 . Since senescence is closely related to chronological aging, we also examined the effects on radiationmediated inflammation on juvenile (1-month-old), adult (6-month-old), and elderly (16-month-old) NFκB-eGFP-luc animals.</p><p>Our overall goals are to determine (1) whether X-ray radiation provokes an IVD-specific NFκB response; (2) whether the NFκB response affects IVD structure, mechanical behavior and matrix composition; (3) whether irradiation has age-dependent effects; and (4) whether IVD structure and mechanical function can be preserved by blunting the transactivation potential of NFκB via ablation of MyD88.</p><p>All procedures were performed with the approval of the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A matching number of female and male were used in each of the transgenic mouse models. However, sex was not considered separately as an independent factor as all studies were conducted ex vivo under sex-independent conditions. A total of 18 Nuclear factor-kappa-B-eGFP-luciferase (NFκB-luc) animals 25 were allowed to achieve 1 month, 6 months, or 16 months of age with six animals in each group, and 18 FSUs in each age group to serve as control or undergo irradiation (n = 9). Each of these samples undergoes NFκB luminescence analyses longitudinally. After completion of the culture period, the FSUs underwent the nondestructive mechanical testing, and then finally divided up to the biochemical assays (n = 6) and histology (n = 3). A previously described method for surgically extracting functional spine units (FSUs) from the lumbar spine was used 9, 23 . Briefly, animals were euthanized using a CO2 smartbox and then a single axial cut using a no. 11 scalpel to expose the lumbar spine on the dorsal surface. Soft tissues surrounding the spinal column were cut away to expose FSUs containing the intact vertebrae-intervertebral disc-vertebrae. Three lumbar FSUs (L1/L2, L3/L4, and L5/L6) were obtained from each animal (Figure 1(a) ). The FSU samples are placed in media containing 2 mL of 1:1 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with Mixture F12 (DMEM: F12, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Media was changed every other day. The samples were subjected to a sterile incubator that maintained 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2, and &gt;90% humidity.</p><p>Eight MyD88-null 26 and WT littermate animals were aged to 6 months and then underwent the same dissection and culture conditions (Figure 1(b) ). Twelve FSUs in each group were cultured for 10 days following irradiation. After completion of the culture period the FSUs were then used for qPCR (n = 3); histological (n = 3); and biochemical and mechanical assessments (n = 6).</p><p>After a preconditioning culture period of 3 days, specimens designated to be irradiated was exposed to a dosing regimen equivalent to 20 Gys using a small animal radiation research platform that delivered soft X-rays from both the top and bottom of the culture plate (SARRP, Xstrahl Life Sciences, Suwanee GA). The ray tube was operated at 160 kVp/25 mA with a dosing rate of 2.9 Gy/min. This dosing was selected as it approximates the biological effective dose experienced by the intervertebral disc for typical radiation treatment for abdominal cancers 2, 7 .</p><p>The NFκB-eGFP-luc FSUs were first imaged at baseline before irradiation and then monitored longitudinally following irradiation at 1 h, 6 h, 1-day, 3-day, 6-day, 8-day, and 10-day time-points by measuring bioluminescence using an IVIS Imaging System 50 (Perkin Elmer., Waltham MA) with a 10 s exposure time and a bin setting of 2. Ten μL of 1 mg/mL luciferin solution (Caliper Life Sciences) was added to each well and incubated for 10 at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2, and &gt;90% humidity prior to imaging. A photographic image concurrently overlaid with the bioluminescence image to identify the anatomical location of NF-kB expression in the IVDs. Contoured ROIs were drawn around each disc, and NFκB expression was measured and normalized to area giving units of photons/s/cm 2 / steradian.</p><p>In the MyD88-null animals, NFκB transactivation potential was probed by measuring the mRNA levels of Inhibitor of κB-α (IκB-α), a critical activator for NFκB 29, 30 , using RT-PCR at the 6 h, 1-day and 3-day time-points following irradiation. IVD tissues were isolated from six FSUs per group, flash frozen, and then pulverized. RNA was stabilized and extracted using RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen USA, Germantown MD), and transcription was performed using SYBR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The amplification primers used for IκB-α sense: 5′-CGCTTGGTGGACGATCG-3′ antisense: 5′-TTGCTCGTACTCCTCGTCCTTC-3′; the 18S primer sense: 5′ ATGGTAGTCGCCGTGCCTAC-3′; antisense: 5′-CCGGAA TCGAACCCTGA TT-3′ 31 .</p><p>The glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) content of the IVD was quantified using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and normalized by collagen content. Isolated IVDs were digested in papain solution overnight at 65 °C using a block heater. The digests were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant ). These FSUs were preconditioned for 3 days and then exposed to 20 Gys of X-ray radiation using a small animal radiotherapy research platform. Following irradiation, the FSUs are cultured and luciferase activity was monitored by bioluminescence at 1 h, 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 6 days, 8 days, and 10 days. At the end of culture, the IVDs were mechanically tested using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. (b) In order to determine whether the changes in the IVD were due to damage to the extracellular matrix or the NFκB signaling, we extracted FSUs from MyD88 null mice and subjected the FSUs to the same radiation and characterization protocols.</p><p>was collected. The supernatant was plated on a 96-well plate and 250μl of DMMB dye was added to each well. The plate was then read at an absorbance frequency of 525 nm using a spectrophotometer and normalized to and a standard curve created from chondroitin sulfate derived from bovine trachea (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The papain-digested lysates were further hydrolyzed by 12N HCL for 24 h at 110 °C and used for collagen quantification 8, 9 . Collagen content was measured using a chloramine-T based colorimetric assay against hydroxyproline, assuming that a 14% composition of hydroxyproline in collagen. Samples undergoing histology were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, decalcified in 5% formic acid for 48 h, and embedded in paraffin. The samples were sectioned in the sagittal direction at 5 mm thickness and then stained using Safranin-O with a Fast Green counterstain. The disc height was measured from the histological images by measuring the average height defined by the major axis of a fitted ellipse across the sagittal section at least 20 locations across the width of the disc 9, 32 .</p><p>The mechanical behavior of the intact IVDs was determined using strain-controlled dynamic compression (BioDent 1000; Active Life Scientific, Santa Barbara, CA) 33 . Under the guidance of a dissection microscope, the bony vertebral bodies of the FSU were partially removed from each sample such that a portion of the vertebra remains intact and maintaining the cartilaginous endplate. The FSUs were then adhered to an aluminum platen by apply cyanoacrylate on the remaining vertebral bone on either end of the FSU. The disc height was calculated by taking an average of three measurements on the longitudinal axis of each disc using a laser micrometer (Keyence, Itasca, IL), and it was used to calculate the input strain values. The sample was then placed in a phosphate-buffered saline bath, preloaded to 0.02N and preconditioned for 10 cycles, and compressed using a sinusoidal waveform at 1 Hz for 20 cycles at the 1% strain level and 5% strain level. The load and displacement values of the IVD were recorded for the duration of the test cycles. The average stiffness was determined from the loading phase of the last cycle, and the energy dissipation was determined from the total hysteresis from all 20 cycles.</p><p>Measures of mechanical stiffness, energy dissipation, glycosaminoglycans, and disc height are normalized to the respective age-matched, non-irradiated controls.</p><p>Levene's statistic was used to confirm the normality of the data. Two-way ANOVAs were used to determine the effects of age and irradiation. Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) was used for measurements made at multiple time-points following radiation, with age and irradiation as factors. Tukey's post hoc comparisons were used to directly compare the readouts from successive time-points against the baseline measurement. In the MyD88 animals, two-way ANOVAs were used to compare the effects of genotype and irradiation. Significance was considered to be p &lt; 0.05. Comparisons are powered to a minimum 1-β of 0.6 or higher. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Prism 6.0; Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).</p><p>After irradiation, the 1-month-old FSUs expressed significantly higher levels of NFκB-driven luciferase activity at just 1 h, 6 h, and 1 day after exposure (Figure 2(a) ). The 6-month-old FSUs showed high levels of NFκB-driven luciferase activity for up to 3 days (Figure 2(b) ). Finally, the 16-month FSUs had significantly higher NFκB-driven luciferase activity throughout the culture period (Figure 2 (c)). The twoway RM ANOVA indicates that radiation (p &lt; 0.001) and age (p &lt; 0.001) were both significant factors on the subsequent NFκB activity. Moreover, age and irradiation produced an interactive effect (p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the data suggest that radiation has a more pronounced effect on the older tissues.</p><p>The mechanical behavior of the intervertebral discs was negatively affected by irradiation (Figure 3(a, b )), except for the 1-month-old FSUs whose mechanical stiffness was not altered (Figure 3(a) ). This is aligned with the reduced duration of NFκB expression and confirms that the 1-month FSUs may be more resilient in the short term when subjected to radiation. Likewise, the disc heights declined in all FSU age groups (Figure 3(c) ). However, 10 days after exposure, the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was reduced due to radiation in every FSU age group (Figure 3(d) ). Consistent with these quantitative measurements, the histological observations revealed noticeable degenerative changes that are progressively more severe in the older FSUs (Figure 4 ).</p><p>Finally, the MyD88-null FSUs showed a muted IκB-α expression up to 3 days following irradiation, suggested the blunted activity of NFκB (Figure 5(a) ). After 10 days in culture, the loss of MyD88 protected the IVDs from the loss of GAGs, disc height, stiffness, or energy dissipation (Figure 5(b) ). The histology of these samples shows that MyD88-null FSUs that are subjected to radiation are indistinguishable from those that were not irradiated (Figure 5(c, d )).</p><p>Using an ex vivo culture model, we demonstrate that the intervertebral disc is responsive to X-ray radiation of 20 Gys. The elevation of NFκB signaling is preferentially perpetuated in older tissues, but all tissues with intact NFκB signaling exposed to radiation resulted in deteriorated structure and impaired mechanical function. Since the ablation of MyD88 limited the subsequent IκB-α/NFκB signaling and protected against mechanical and structural deterioration, it suggests that the effects of radiation on the IVD at this dose are driven by NFκB signaling. Prior work on X-rayirradiated bone shows that collagen cleavage occurs at 25-35 Gys 8, 34 .</p><p>It was previously observed that X-ray irradiation delivered to the whole-body and focused on the mouse tail causes IVD degeneration 11 , but it is unclear whether the degenerative factors are derived from the IVD or sourced from adjacent bone and surrounding tissues 3, 7 . We clarify here that the IVD has an autologous response to irradiation independently surrounding anatomical tissues. The agedependence in the irradiation-induced NFκB signaling suggests that old tissues, which are more senescent to start with 27, 35 , may be more susceptible to genotoxic perturbations. The perpetuation of NFκB signaling is similar to the persistent injury that in turn drives degeneration 9, 16 and eventual chronicity of low back pain symptoms 19 . IVD cells have also been shown to be responsive to ionizing gamma radiation 10, 36 . Although gamma radiation is rare, astronauts are routinely subjected to such radiation while in space 37, 38 . Astronauts have reported to have a disproportionate incidence of IVD damage and degeneration that have been attributed to microgravity 39, 40 ; however, whether radiation-mediated inflammatory responses from the IVD 41 may also contribute to the degeneration of the IVD and subsequent low back pain have not been investigated.</p><p>There are a number of limitations that should be noted when considering this study. NFκB signal was reported by luciferase activity at the transcriptional level, but we did not enumerate the specific factors that solicit the NFκB response. Previous works have shown that TLR ligands are the primary biological responder in radiation 13, 42 and signals to NFκB. Though we cannot  exclude the possibility of other radiation-sensitive receptors, the muted NFκB response when MyD88, the adapter protein downstream of TLRs, RAGE, and HMGB1 28, 43, 44 , is ablated suggests that these are the primary pathways by which radiation stimulates NFκB. NFκB functions as an integrator of molecular inflammation, and low back pain is associated with many of the cytokines that downstream of NFκB. Future work will investigate the radiation-sensitive factors and their effects on the IVD. The radiation regimen applied here is also higher than the typical environmental exposure, but studies have shown that low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation can contribute to vascular disease that may adversely affect the nutrition supply of the IVD and consequently promote IVD degeneration 1, 45 . In using the organ culture approach, we have not accounted for the likely interactions between the IVD and the immune cascade 46 that may lead to a painful physiology 47 . The organ culture conditions here also utilize some nonphysiological conditions that included the use of 20% serum and normoxia; however, it does recapitulate the cellular inflammatory responses [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . It is nevertheless important to perform future studies under physiological conditions if possible. While we have specifically examined the mechanical, inflammatory, structural, and compositional effects of irradiation and MyD88 ablation, we did not perform histological grading here. Indeed, histological grading is commonly performed for IVD degeneration, either following aging, genetic modification, treatment, or injury [48] [49] [50] . With the exception of injury models, degeneration is typically evaluated as a long-term response of the IVD. The current study, however, examines the short-term response of IVD to irradiation and this time frame is typically too short to achieve a phenotype that can be resolved by well-developed histological grading criterion. Future work will include the long-term biological and the mechanical consequences of ionizing radiation on the IVD at the genetic (i.e. using RNA-seq) and tissue scales in order to develop effective therapeutics and countermeasures.</p><p>This study received support from the Washington University Musculoskeletal Research Center NIH P30 AR057235 , NIH UL1 TR002345 , NIH K01 AR069116 , NIH R21 AR069804 , and NIH R01 AR074441 .

We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFκB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFκB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFκB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFκB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFκB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFκB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFκB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFκB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroductionIonizing radiation commonly utilized in medicine particularly for X-ray tomography, surgical guidance, and radiotherapy 1 can be as high as 50 Gys 2 . Although radiation in this setting has clear therapeutic and medical value, it is important to consider the unintended consequences of high-dose ionizing radiation. The effects of radiation on cells and DNA damage are well documented 3 and negatively affect multiple organ systems including the heart, lung, and kidneys [4][5][6] . Patients receiving focal radiation treatment for abdominal cancers experience a dramatic bone loss resulting in a high proportion of vertebral compression fractures 7 , highlighting severe consequences of focused radiation on peripheral tissues 3 . Ionizing radiation can also damage the extracellular matrix, by cleaving the protein structure and creating crosslinks 8 . Immediately adjacent to the vertebrae, the intervertebral disc (IVD) may also be susceptible to radiation exposure.The IVD consists of cells that are metabolically responsive to environmental conditions including injury 9 , senescence 10 , and genotoxic signals that include reactive oxygen species, advanced glycation endproducts, and radiation 11 . Exposure to these toxic and damage factors in turn can trigger toll-like receptors (TLRs) [12][13][14] and interleukins-1 receptors (IL1Rs) 10 that activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling and inducing the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines 15 . The prolonged expression of these inflammatory cytokines is tightly linked to IVD injury, degeneration 16,17 , and low back pain 18,19 . However, the effects of ionizing radiation on the IVD at the cell and tissue levels remain relatively unknown.Since radiation can concurrently affect multiple organs, whose responses may in turn cross-talk with the organ of interest, the ex vivo IVD organ culture approach is particularly elegant for decoupling the tissue-specific vs. the systemic effects of complex stimuli [20][21][22] . The use of genetically modified mouse models provides additional mechanistic insights by enabling the real-time reporting of molecular events or the ablation key signaling pathways 9 . Thus, to investigate the effects of X-ray radiation on the IVD, we applied an organ culture of mouse functional spine units (FSUs) 9,23 . The FSUs are exposed to a single regimen X-ray radiation totaling 20 Gys, which is in the range of clinical use for radiotherapy 2,7 and cultured for 10 days to observe the downstream effects of radiation.Because NFκB integrates signaling from radiationsensitive receptors 24 , we utilized mice with an NFκB-driven bioluminescence reporter (NFκB-eGFPluc) 25 to monitor the IVD-specific temporal response to X-ray irradiation. In order to decouple the radiationmediated inflammatory response from the matrix-level effects, we utilized a mouse with a global deficiency in myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) 26 . MyD88 is an adapter protein that transfers signals from toll-like receptors, advanced glycation end-products receptors, and interleukin receptors to initiate NFκB signaling, and it has crucial roles in inflammatory and senescence-related degeneration of the intervertebral disc 27,28 . Since senescence is closely related to chronological aging, we also examined the effects on radiationmediated inflammation on juvenile (1-month-old), adult (6-month-old), and elderly (16-month-old) NFκB-eGFP-luc animals.Our overall goals are to determine (1) whether X-ray radiation provokes an IVD-specific NFκB response; (2) whether the NFκB response affects IVD structure, mechanical behavior and matrix composition; (3) whether irradiation has age-dependent effects; and (4) whether IVD structure and mechanical function can be preserved by blunting the transactivation potential of NFκB via ablation of MyD88.\\nMaterials and methods\\nAnimals and culture conditionsAll procedures were performed with the approval of the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A matching number of female and male were used in each of the transgenic mouse models. However, sex was not considered separately as an independent factor as all studies were conducted ex vivo under sex-independent conditions. A total of 18 Nuclear factor-kappa-B-eGFP-luciferase (NFκB-luc) animals 25 were allowed to achieve 1 month, 6 months, or 16 months of age with six animals in each group, and 18 FSUs in each age group to serve as control or undergo irradiation (n = 9). Each of these samples undergoes NFκB luminescence analyses longitudinally. After completion of the culture period, the FSUs underwent the nondestructive mechanical testing, and then finally divided up to the biochemical assays (n = 6) and histology (n = 3). A previously described method for surgically extracting functional spine units (FSUs) from the lumbar spine was used 9,23 . Briefly, animals were euthanized using a CO2 smartbox and then a single axial cut using a no. 11 scalpel to expose the lumbar spine on the dorsal surface. Soft tissues surrounding the spinal column were cut away to expose FSUs containing the intact vertebrae-intervertebral disc-vertebrae. Three lumbar FSUs (L1/L2, L3/L4, and L5/L6) were obtained from each animal (Figure 1(a)). The FSU samples are placed in media containing 2 mL of 1:1 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with Mixture F12 (DMEM: F12, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Media was changed every other day. The samples were subjected to a sterile incubator that maintained 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2, and >90% humidity.Eight MyD88-null 26 and WT littermate animals were aged to 6 months and then underwent the same dissection and culture conditions (Figure 1(b)). Twelve FSUs in each group were cultured for 10 days following irradiation. After completion of the culture period the FSUs were then used for qPCR (n = 3); histological (n = 3); and biochemical and mechanical assessments (n = 6).\\nX-ray irradiation and monitoring of NFκB signalingAfter a preconditioning culture period of 3 days, specimens designated to be irradiated was exposed to a dosing regimen equivalent to 20 Gys using a small animal radiation research platform that delivered soft X-rays from both the top and bottom of the culture plate (SARRP, Xstrahl Life Sciences, Suwanee GA). The ray tube was operated at 160 kVp/25 mA with a dosing rate of 2.9 Gy/min. This dosing was selected as it approximates the biological effective dose experienced by the intervertebral disc for typical radiation treatment for abdominal cancers 2,7 .The NFκB-eGFP-luc FSUs were first imaged at baseline before irradiation and then monitored longitudinally following irradiation at 1 h, 6 h, 1-day, 3-day, 6-day, 8-day, and 10-day time-points by measuring bioluminescence using an IVIS Imaging System 50 (Perkin Elmer., Waltham MA) with a 10 s exposure time and a bin setting of 2. Ten μL of 1 mg/mL luciferin solution (Caliper Life Sciences) was added to each well and incubated for 10 at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2, and >90% humidity prior to imaging. A photographic image concurrently overlaid with the bioluminescence image to identify the anatomical location of NF-kB expression in the IVDs. Contoured ROIs were drawn around each disc, and NFκB expression was measured and normalized to area giving units of photons/s/cm 2 / steradian.In the MyD88-null animals, NFκB transactivation potential was probed by measuring the mRNA levels of Inhibitor of κB-α (IκB-α), a critical activator for NFκB 29,30 , using RT-PCR at the 6 h, 1-day and 3-day time-points following irradiation. IVD tissues were isolated from six FSUs per group, flash frozen, and then pulverized. RNA was stabilized and extracted using RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen USA, Germantown MD), and transcription was performed using SYBR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The amplification primers used for IκB-α sense: 5′-CGCTTGGTGGACGATCG-3′ antisense: 5′-TTGCTCGTACTCCTCGTCCTTC-3′; the 18S primer sense: 5′ ATGGTAGTCGCCGTGCCTAC-3′; antisense: 5′-CCGGAA TCGAACCCTGA TT-3′ 31 .\\nBiochemical, histological, and disc height analysesThe glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) content of the IVD was quantified using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and normalized by collagen content. Isolated IVDs were digested in papain solution overnight at 65 °C using a block heater. The digests were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant ). These FSUs were preconditioned for 3 days and then exposed to 20 Gys of X-ray radiation using a small animal radiotherapy research platform. Following irradiation, the FSUs are cultured and luciferase activity was monitored by bioluminescence at 1 h, 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 6 days, 8 days, and 10 days. At the end of culture, the IVDs were mechanically tested using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. (b) In order to determine whether the changes in the IVD were due to damage to the extracellular matrix or the NFκB signaling, we extracted FSUs from MyD88 null mice and subjected the FSUs to the same radiation and characterization protocols.was collected. The supernatant was plated on a 96-well plate and 250μl of DMMB dye was added to each well. The plate was then read at an absorbance frequency of 525 nm using a spectrophotometer and normalized to and a standard curve created from chondroitin sulfate derived from bovine trachea (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The papain-digested lysates were further hydrolyzed by 12N HCL for 24 h at 110 °C and used for collagen quantification 8,9 . Collagen content was measured using a chloramine-T based colorimetric assay against hydroxyproline, assuming that a 14% composition of hydroxyproline in collagen. Samples undergoing histology were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, decalcified in 5% formic acid for 48 h, and embedded in paraffin. The samples were sectioned in the sagittal direction at 5 mm thickness and then stained using Safranin-O with a Fast Green counterstain. The disc height was measured from the histological images by measuring the average height defined by the major axis of a fitted ellipse across the sagittal section at least 20 locations across the width of the disc 9,32 .\\nMechanical testing using dynamic compressionThe mechanical behavior of the intact IVDs was determined using strain-controlled dynamic compression (BioDent 1000; Active Life Scientific, Santa Barbara, CA) 33 . Under the guidance of a dissection microscope, the bony vertebral bodies of the FSU were partially removed from each sample such that a portion of the vertebra remains intact and maintaining the cartilaginous endplate. The FSUs were then adhered to an aluminum platen by apply cyanoacrylate on the remaining vertebral bone on either end of the FSU. The disc height was calculated by taking an average of three measurements on the longitudinal axis of each disc using a laser micrometer (Keyence, Itasca, IL), and it was used to calculate the input strain values. The sample was then placed in a phosphate-buffered saline bath, preloaded to 0.02N and preconditioned for 10 cycles, and compressed using a sinusoidal waveform at 1 Hz for 20 cycles at the 1% strain level and 5% strain level. The load and displacement values of the IVD were recorded for the duration of the test cycles. The average stiffness was determined from the loading phase of the last cycle, and the energy dissipation was determined from the total hysteresis from all 20 cycles.\\nStatistical analysesMeasures of mechanical stiffness, energy dissipation, glycosaminoglycans, and disc height are normalized to the respective age-matched, non-irradiated controls.Levene's statistic was used to confirm the normality of the data. Two-way ANOVAs were used to determine the effects of age and irradiation. Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) was used for measurements made at multiple time-points following radiation, with age and irradiation as factors. Tukey's post hoc comparisons were used to directly compare the readouts from successive time-points against the baseline measurement. In the MyD88 animals, two-way ANOVAs were used to compare the effects of genotype and irradiation. Significance was considered to be p < 0.05. Comparisons are powered to a minimum 1-β of 0.6 or higher. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Prism 6.0; Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).\\nResultsAfter irradiation, the 1-month-old FSUs expressed significantly higher levels of NFκB-driven luciferase activity at just 1 h, 6 h, and 1 day after exposure (Figure 2(a)). The 6-month-old FSUs showed high levels of NFκB-driven luciferase activity for up to 3 days (Figure 2(b)). Finally, the 16-month FSUs had significantly higher NFκB-driven luciferase activity throughout the culture period (Figure 2(c)). The twoway RM ANOVA indicates that radiation (p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001) were both significant factors on the subsequent NFκB activity. Moreover, age and irradiation produced an interactive effect (p < 0.05). Taken together, the data suggest that radiation has a more pronounced effect on the older tissues.The mechanical behavior of the intervertebral discs was negatively affected by irradiation (Figure 3(a,b)), except for the 1-month-old FSUs whose mechanical stiffness was not altered (Figure 3(a)). This is aligned with the reduced duration of NFκB expression and confirms that the 1-month FSUs may be more resilient in the short term when subjected to radiation. Likewise, the disc heights declined in all FSU age groups (Figure 3(c)). However, 10 days after exposure, the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was reduced due to radiation in every FSU age group (Figure 3(d)). Consistent with these quantitative measurements, the histological observations revealed noticeable degenerative changes that are progressively more severe in the older FSUs (Figure 4).Finally, the MyD88-null FSUs showed a muted IκB-α expression up to 3 days following irradiation, suggested the blunted activity of NFκB (Figure 5(a)). After 10 days in culture, the loss of MyD88 protected the IVDs from the loss of GAGs, disc height, stiffness, or energy dissipation (Figure 5(b)). The histology of these samples shows that MyD88-null FSUs that are subjected to radiation are indistinguishable from those that were not irradiated (Figure 5(c,d)).\\nDiscussionUsing an ex vivo culture model, we demonstrate that the intervertebral disc is responsive to X-ray radiation of 20 Gys. The elevation of NFκB signaling is preferentially perpetuated in older tissues, but all tissues with intact NFκB signaling exposed to radiation resulted in deteriorated structure and impaired mechanical function. Since the ablation of MyD88 limited the subsequent IκB-α/NFκB signaling and protected against mechanical and structural deterioration, it suggests that the effects of radiation on the IVD at this dose are driven by NFκB signaling. Prior work on X-rayirradiated bone shows that collagen cleavage occurs at 25-35 Gys 8,34 .It was previously observed that X-ray irradiation delivered to the whole-body and focused on the mouse tail causes IVD degeneration 11 , but it is unclear whether the degenerative factors are derived from the IVD or sourced from adjacent bone and surrounding tissues 3,7 . We clarify here that the IVD has an autologous response to irradiation independently surrounding anatomical tissues. The agedependence in the irradiation-induced NFκB signaling suggests that old tissues, which are more senescent to start with 27,35 , may be more susceptible to genotoxic perturbations. The perpetuation of NFκB signaling is similar to the persistent injury that in turn drives degeneration 9,16  and eventual chronicity of low back pain symptoms 19 . IVD cells have also been shown to be responsive to ionizing gamma radiation 10,36 . Although gamma radiation is rare, astronauts are routinely subjected to such radiation while in space 37,38 . Astronauts have reported to have a disproportionate incidence of IVD damage and degeneration that have been attributed to microgravity 39,40 ; however, whether radiation-mediated inflammatory responses from the IVD 41 may also contribute to the degeneration of the IVD and subsequent low back pain have not been investigated.There are a number of limitations that should be noted when considering this study. NFκB signal was reported by luciferase activity at the transcriptional level, but we did not enumerate the specific factors that solicit the NFκB response. Previous works have shown that TLR ligands are the primary biological responder in radiation 13,42 and signals to NFκB. Though we cannot  exclude the possibility of other radiation-sensitive receptors, the muted NFκB response when MyD88, the adapter protein downstream of TLRs, RAGE, and HMGB1 28,43,44 , is ablated suggests that these are the primary pathways by which radiation stimulates NFκB. NFκB functions as an integrator of molecular inflammation, and low back pain is associated with many of the cytokines that downstream of NFκB. Future work will investigate the radiation-sensitive factors and their effects on the IVD. The radiation regimen applied here is also higher than the typical environmental exposure, but studies have shown that low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation can contribute to vascular disease that may adversely affect the nutrition supply of the IVD and consequently promote IVD degeneration 1,45 . In using the organ culture approach, we have not accounted for the likely interactions between the IVD and the immune cascade 46 that may lead to a painful physiology 47 . The organ culture conditions here also utilize some nonphysiological conditions that included the use of 20% serum and normoxia; however, it does recapitulate the cellular inflammatory responses [10][11][12][13][14] . It is nevertheless important to perform future studies under physiological conditions if possible. While we have specifically examined the mechanical, inflammatory, structural, and compositional effects of irradiation and MyD88 ablation, we did not perform histological grading here. Indeed, histological grading is commonly performed for IVD degeneration, either following aging, genetic modification, treatment, or injury [48][49][50] . With the exception of injury models, degeneration is typically evaluated as a long-term response of the IVD. The current study, however, examines the short-term response of IVD to irradiation and this time frame is typically too short to achieve a phenotype that can be resolved by well-developed histological grading criterion. Future work will include the long-term biological and the mechanical consequences of ionizing radiation on the IVD at the genetic (i.e. using RNA-seq) and tissue scales in order to develop effective therapeutics and countermeasures.  Figure 1 .1Figure1. Utilizing ex vivo organ culture of functional spine units (FSUs), we examined the effects of ionizing radiation on the intervertebral disc (IVD). (a) 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFκB-eGFP-luc animals were utilized. The lumbar spine is dissected such that three intact lumbar FSUs are obtained from each animal (L1/L2, L3/L4, and L5/L6). These FSUs were preconditioned for 3 days and then exposed to 20 Gys of X-ray radiation using a small animal radiotherapy research platform. Following irradiation, the FSUs are cultured and luciferase activity was monitored by bioluminescence at 1 h, 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 6 days, 8 days, and 10 days. At the end of culture, the IVDs were mechanically tested using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. (b) In order to determine whether the changes in the IVD were due to damage to the extracellular matrix or the NFκB signaling, we extracted FSUs from MyD88 null mice and subjected the FSUs to the same radiation and characterization protocols.\\nFigure 2 .2Figure 2. In the NFκB-eGFP-luc functional spine units (FSUs), bioluminescence was monitored at baseline following preconditioning, then at 1 h, 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 6 days, 8 days, and 10 days following the irradiation at 20 Gys. (a) In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFκB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. (b) The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFκB activity for 3 days, (c) while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFκB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. These results suggest that increasing age may increase susceptibility to radiation-mediated inflammation. (d) Images from the IVIS at the peak NFκB-expressing time point of 6 h show increased luciferase activity throughout the cultured FSU. Post-hoc comparisons were done with against the baseline with * denoting p < 0.05; ** denotes p < 0.01; *** denotes p < 0.001 (n = 9; Two-way RM ANOVA).\\nFigure 3 .3Figure 3. (a, b)The stiffness and energy dissipation of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) were measured using cyclic compression. The 6-month and 16-month FSUs experienced a significant reduction in stiffness from the baseline while the 1-month FSUs remained relatively unchanged. The ability of the FSU to dissipate energy was dramatically reduced in all groups. (c) Correspondingly, the disc heights of the IVDs were reduced in all groups 10 days following irradiation. (d) A dimethyl-methylene blue assay was used to quantify the amount of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs-normalized to total collagen content) in the intervertebral discs, and exposure to 20 Gys of radiation resulted in a significant decline in the GAGs content. For all measured outcomes, both age and irradiation were significant factors. Post-hoc comparisons were done with against the baseline with * p < 0.05 (n = 6; Two-way ANOVA).\\nFigure 4 .4Figure 4. Histological evaluation of paraffinized sections stained with Safranin-O and Fast Green revealed the structural changes in the IVD due to radiation, particularly in the 6-month and 16-month FSUs (n = 3). High magnification insets of the annulus fibrosusnucleus pulposus border are also provided. The alterations in structure can be observed through the loss of Safranin-O staining that confirms the reduction of glycosaminoglycans, increased cell clustering in the central nucleus pulposus, and the loss of the annulus fibrosus-nucleus pulposus border. These changes are particularly pronounced in the 16-month-old FSUs that were subjected to the 20 Gys of radiation.\\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [K01 AR069116, P30 AR057235, R01 AR074441, R21 AR069804, UL1 TR002345].\\nFigure 5 .5Figure 5. Functional spine units (FSUs) extracted from 6-month-old MyD88 null mice were randomized into a control and irradiated group exposed to 20 Gys of ionizing radiation. (a) qPCR for IκB-α confirms the unchanged NFκB transactivation potential in MyD88null FSUs subjected to radiation (n = 6). The histological findings also indicated the MyD88-mediated attenuation of NFκB-signaling preserves the IVD structure with clear delineation of the microstructural features when comparing the (b) irradiated to the (c) nonirradiated controls. High magnification insets of the annulus fibrosus-nucleus pulposus border are also provided (n = 3). (e-h) Similarly, the glycosaminoglycan, disc height, and mechanical analyses confirm that no adverse changes occurred in the irradiated MyD88-null FSUs (n = 9; p > 0.05 for all comparisons; Two-way ANOVA).\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgmentsThis study received support from the Washington University Musculoskeletal Research Center NIH P30 AR057235, NIH UL1 TR002345, NIH K01 AR069116, NIH R21 AR069804, and NIH R01 AR074441.
